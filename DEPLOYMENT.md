## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Working**
   - Verify API key is correctly set in environment variables
   - Check API key permissions and quotas
   - Ensure no extra spaces or characters

2. **Build Failures**
   - Run `npm run type-check` to identify TypeScript errors
   - Check for missing dependencies
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Analyze bundle size with `npm run build:analyze`
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Implement code splitting if needed

4. **Mobile Issues**
   - Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
